The cp command is the 'copy' command, and takes two parameters: the location and name of the file or folder you would like to copy, and the location and file name of where you would like to copy it to.

for e.g:

cp newfile ../newfilecopy

This would copy the file newfile to the parent directory and call it newfilecopy. Neat!
