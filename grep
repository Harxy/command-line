the grep command allows you to search within files. So, for instance, if you were to type:

grep 'hello' helloworld.txt

This would return every line in helloworld.txt that had the text hello in it.

you could also just look for lines that have words beginning with 'h' or 'H'. You would do this like this:

grep [^hH] helloworld.txt
