The ps command shows you all the processes that bash is using on your computer, by default. It's sort of like a task manager for bash and you can easily see all the processes that are running.

However, by simply adding:

ps -x

The -x now makes ps do the same thing but for ALL your processes... bash and otherwise. This makes it even more like the task manager.
