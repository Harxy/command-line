The wc command is the word count command, and can be used like this:

wc my_file.txt

this will return the word count of the file my_file.txt. However, it actually returns 3 numbers - the line count, the word count and the bytes count.

If you don't want all that information (maybe just the line count?) then you can do it like this:

wc -l

(only returns line count)

wc -w

(only returns the word count)

wc -m

(only returns the character count)
